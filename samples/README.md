# samples

folders in this directory (and data within them) are generated automatically

the names follow this pattern:
```
job_N_<number of points>p_{number of connection per point}c_<minimum distance between points in divisions>d
```

all automatically generated data has the resolution of 128 divisions

automatically generated data is not manually checked

files `32x32x32_dense.otbv` and `32x32x32_sparse.otbv` were generated and checked manually
